# databaseProject

I was tasked with creating a database for a pizzeria to use for my Database Systems class in Fall 2023.

Prior to starting the SQL part of the project, I created a complex entity relationship diagram to cover all the things a pizzeria might need to keep track of.

This repository contains only three other files, one for creating all of the tables, one for inserting the data into those tables, and one containing the queries we were to create to test our database.

This project was not completed using git, instead it was uploaded to github later (hence the lack of commits).
